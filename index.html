            Usually, we set too high or too far-off goals. It's important to have lofty goals, but you have to take small steps along the way. Though it might be a long way off, as long as you keep progressing each day, you'll get there. So, set small goals that will help you get there.
            You'll get some quick wins, but you'll also make progress on your bigger projects.
